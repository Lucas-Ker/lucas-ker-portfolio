# Data Science Portfolio — Lucas Ker

Hello — welcome to my portfolio. Below you’ll find concise, client-ready deliverables and links to full technical projects and notebooks. My work focuses on reproducible analytics pipelines and business-facing deliverables for e-commerce and experimental-data problems.

## Executive deliverables

* **reports/Olist_Executive_Summary.pdf** — 1-page executive summary of the Olist analysis (key insights & recommended actions).

* **notebooks/Olist_Client_Highlights.ipynb** — short, clean notebook that shows the top 3 Olist insights in ~5 minutes.

* **notebooks/Stats_for_Business_Client.ipynb** — practical guide: how to use statistical tests and basic inference to answer business questions.

## Deep-dive projects

### Full Project: E-commerce Analysis (Olist) — 5-notebook pipeline

**Repository:** [https://github.com/Lucas-Ker/olist-data-analysis-project](https://github.com/Lucas-Ker/olist-data-analysis-project)

**What it is:** End-to-end pipeline (data ingestion & ETL, exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, RFM segmentation & K-Means, predictive prototypes using Random Forest & Prophet).

**Key result:** Prototype model to flag orders with high risk of negative reviews — **68% recall** on the test set (k-fold CV). (See `notebooks/` for evaluation details and confusion matrices.)

### Practical Guide: Statistics for Data Science

**Repository:** [https://github.com/Lucas-Ker/stats_for_data_science](https://github.com/Lucas-Ker/stats_for_data_science)

**What it is:** Hands-on guide to the fundamental concepts of statistics, building from foundational theory to practical application in Data Science and Machine Learning.

## Deliverables & formats

* Notebook (Jupyter) — documented & reproducible; includes instructions to reproduce results (requirements.txt).

* PDF report — executive summary with visuals ready for stakeholders.

* Data exports — aggregated CSVs (where allowed) and feature tables.

## How I work

* Reproducible pipelines: clear notebooks + modular scripts.

* Business focus: translate technical results into 2–3 actionable recommendations.

* Communication: regular checkpoints, clear deliverables and documentation.
